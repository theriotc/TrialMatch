Patient: I'm okay, doctor. I've noticed I've been more thirsty than usual and peeing at night more frequently.

Doctor: Understood. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling?

Patient: No, none of that.

Doctor: Let's review your history. You are 48, have type 2 diabetes for about 8 years, and have high blood pressure, correct?

Patient: That's right. I also developed mild chronic kidney disease about a year ago â€” Stage 3A.

Doctor: Are you still taking your current medications?

Patient: Yes. I take metformin 1000mg twice daily and lisinopril 10mg once daily.

Doctor: Great. Your recent labs show eGFR is 55%, Hemoglobin A1C is 8.2%

Doctor: Based on this, I'll prescribe Jardiance 10mg once daily. It helps improve blood sugar control and protects your kidneys and heart.

Patient: Sounds good. I'll start that.

Doctor: Follow up in 3 months for labs and to check for side effects.`;
