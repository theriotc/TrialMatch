    transcript: `Doctor: Hello Ms. Johnson, thanks for coming in today. How are you feeling?

Patient: I'm okay, doctor. I've noticed I've been more thirsty than usual and peeing at night more frequently.

Doctor: Understood. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling?

Patient: No, none of that.

Doctor: Let's review your history. You are 48, have type 2 diabetes for about 8 years, and have high blood pressure, correct?

Patient: That's right. I also developed mild chronic kidney disease about a year ago â€” Stage 3A.

Doctor: Are you still taking your current medications?

Patient: Yes. I take metformin 1000mg twice daily and lisinopril 10mg once daily.

Doctor: Great. Your recent labs show eGFR is 55%, Hemoglobin A1C is 8.2%

Doctor: Based on this, I'll prescribe Jardiance 10mg once daily. It helps improve blood sugar control and protects your kidneys and heart.

Patient: Sounds good. I'll start that.

Doctor: Follow up in 3 months for labs and to check for side effects.`

    transcript: `Doctor: Good morning, Mrs. Rodriguez. How are you today?

Patient: I'm doing well, doctor. I'm here for my annual checkup.

Doctor: Great. I see you're 52 years old. Any new symptoms or concerns?

Patient: No major concerns, but I did notice a small lump in my left breast about a week ago.

Doctor: I understand that can be concerning. Can you tell me more about it?

Patient: It's about the size of a pea, not painful, and I found it during my monthly self-exam.

Doctor: Good that you're doing self-exams. When was your last mammogram?

Patient: It was about 14 months ago, and it was normal.

Doctor: Given your age and the new finding, I'd like to order a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. We should also do a clinical breast exam today.

Patient: That sounds good. I'm a bit worried though.

Doctor: It's natural to be concerned, but most breast lumps are benign. We'll get this checked out thoroughly.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. When should I schedule the mammogram?

Doctor: I'd recommend within the next week. I'll also refer you to a breast specialist for further evaluation.`

    transcript: `Doctor: Hello Mr. Thompson, how have you been feeling since our last visit?

Patient: Not great, doctor. I've been more short of breath lately, especially when I walk up stairs.

Doctor: I see. Any swelling in your legs or ankles?

Patient: Yes, my ankles have been swollen for the past few days.

Doctor: How about your weight? Have you noticed any changes?

Patient: I think I've gained about 5 pounds in the last week.

Doctor: Are you still taking your medications as prescribed?

Patient: I've been taking lisinopril and metoprolol, but I ran out of furosemide about a week ago.

Doctor: That explains the symptoms. The furosemide helps remove excess fluid. Let's get you back on it.

Patient: I was feeling better when I was taking it regularly.

Doctor: Exactly. I'm going to restart the furosemide and also check your potassium levels. We might need to adjust the dose.

Patient: Should I be concerned about these symptoms?

Doctor: These are signs that your heart failure needs better management. Let's get you back on track with the medications and see you in 2 weeks.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to take all my medications.`

    transcript: `Doctor: Hi Sarah, how have you been feeling since our last session?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been having trouble sleeping and my anxiety has been really bad.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about the anxiety? What triggers it?

Patient: Mostly work stress. I've been having panic attacks almost daily, especially before meetings.

Doctor: How long has this been going on?

Patient: About 3 weeks now. I also feel really down and don't want to do things I used to enjoy.

Doctor: Are you still taking the sertraline I prescribed?

Patient: I stopped taking it about a month ago because I was feeling better.

Doctor: I understand, but stopping antidepressants suddenly can cause symptoms to return. How's your sleep?

Patient: I'm lucky if I get 4 hours a night. My mind just won't shut off.

Doctor: And your appetite?

Patient: I've lost about 8 pounds because I'm not really hungry.

Doctor: These are classic signs of depression and anxiety returning. Let's restart the sertraline and I'd like to refer you to a therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy.

Patient: Do you think that will help?

Doctor: Yes, the combination of medication and therapy is very effective for anxiety and depression. Let's get you feeling better.`

    transcript: `Doctor: Good morning, Mrs. Chen. How are your joints feeling today?

Patient: They're quite stiff and painful, especially in the morning. It takes me about an hour to get moving.

Doctor: Which joints are bothering you the most?

Patient: My hands, wrists, and knees are the worst. The pain is symmetrical on both sides.

Doctor: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

Patient: About 6 months now. It started gradually but has been getting worse.

Doctor: Are you taking any medications for the pain?

Patient: Just over-the-counter ibuprofen, but it's not helping much anymore.

Doctor: Have you noticed any swelling or redness in the joints?

Patient: Yes, my fingers are swollen and feel warm to the touch.

Doctor: I'm going to order some blood tests to check for inflammatory markers and rheumatoid factor. I suspect you may have rheumatoid arthritis.

Patient: Is that serious? What does this mean?

Doctor: RA is an autoimmune condition that can be managed with proper treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to preventing joint damage.

Patient: What kind of treatment will I need?

Doctor: We'll likely start with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. I'll also refer you to a rheumatologist for specialized care.`

    transcript: `Doctor: Good morning, Mr. Lee. How are you today?

Patient: I'm doing alright, Doctor. I've noticed my hair has been thinning over the past six months.

Doctor: I see you're 40 years old. Where are you noticing the thinning?

Patient: Mostly at the back of my head.

Doctor: Are you currently on any medications, or do you have any allergies?

Patient: No medications and no allergies. I'm healthy otherwise.

Doctor: Based on what you've described, this is likely alopecia, or male pattern hair loss. I recommend starting minoxidil 2.5 mg once daily. It may take three to six months to see results.

Patient: Okay, I'm willing to try that.

Doctor: Great. Continue your normal routine, and follow up in three months to check your progress.`
